abstract = {Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions, from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated. After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance starts deteriorating.}

ABSTRACT = {Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that has gained popularity in recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not enough to forecast its future level, and other price-related features are necessary to improve forecast accuracy. We introduce a new set of time series and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy are open, high, and low, with the largest contribution of low in combination with an ensemble of a gated recurrent unit network and a baseline forecast. The relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the state of the art when observing directional accuracy.},
